# mean-musiclib
A starter application for music director and librarian to prepare playlist and parts for a concert, uses MEAN stack.
This implements a small portion of a workflow that is required to establish a playlist and orchestra parts for a concert. 
This is most relevant when a concert has several pieces and music needs to be ordered from different souces e.g. imslp.org, publisher, 
composer etc. The MEAN stack has been used primarily for my learning purposes.
